# Spring IoT Challenge :+1:


## Quick overview

Main features:
* Dockerized Spring Boot Java 17 REST Api for SIM management
* Docker compose
* Ran out of time for other stuff like using Spring Retry, Kafka and general error handling (sorry!)


## Trying it out

### Replicated with compose :airplane:
`docker compose up --build`
